# makefile-template-c
A generic C Makefile template

I've created this C Makefile template to help me on projects here and there. I hope it's useful for someone else.

A few instructions:

- All .c source files are found using wildcard.
- Don't forget to add your include folders to the ```INCLUDE``` variable if they're not in the same path as your sources.
- Change ```MAIN``` variable to the name of your binary.
